# Windows Activation Tool (Work in Progress)

> ⚠️ This project is a work in progress. The code is not perfect, but it works. I have tried my best.

## Overview
This is a simple Windows desktop application built with WPF.  
It automates Windows activation using generic keys and KMS tickets.  

- Installs a generic key for your Windows edition.
- Copies and applies a KMS ticket.
- Runs `clipup.exe` to finalize activation.
- Shows success or error messages to the user.

## Status
- ✅ Works for its intended purpose.
- ⚠️ Code is messy and might not be the cleanest.
- 🔧 Still under development and improvements are expected.

## Usage
1. Run the app **as Administrator**.
2. Make sure the `Tickets\KMS38.xml` file exists in the application directory.
3. Click the activation button in the app.
4. The app will show a message box with success or failure.

## Notes
- I know the code is not the best. This is my first attempt at a working desktop app.
